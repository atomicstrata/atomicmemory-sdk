/**
 * @file MetaFactFilter
 *
 * Post-retrieval filter that drops "meta-facts" — extraction artifacts that
 * describe the conversation itself rather than recording a durable fact about
 * the user.
 *
 * Empirically motivated by AlignBench v0 (benchmarks/alignbench/RESULTS.md):
 * when extraction-style meta-facts ("The user asked for the user's name.",
 * "As of <date>, X is a term mentioned in the conversation.") sit in the
 * recall pool alongside real user facts, they often outrank the real fact
 * for pronoun and temporal queries — at thin cosine margins (~0.05). The
 * pre-registered "fix the query side" hypothesis was falsified; the dominant
 * fixable lift came from removing meta-facts from the pool.
 *
 * Long-term, core should not emit these facts at extraction time. This
 * SDK-side filter is the safety net so apps consuming the SDK today see
 * cleaner recall results without waiting on a core release.
 *
 * Default patterns target the verbatim shapes observed in the partner demo
 * (atomicmem.filecoin.cloud). Apps can extend or replace them via
 * `MetaFactFilterConfig.patterns`.
 *
 * This filter is intentionally:
 *   - pure (no I/O, no LLM calls — deterministic regex application);
 *   - opt-in (off unless explicitly enabled in provider config);
 *   - case-insensitive;
 *   - additive (apps may add patterns without losing the defaults).
 */

/**
 * Built-in patterns observed in real partner demos. Each is a case-insensitive
 * regex matched against the memory's content. A match drops the memory from
 * the result set.
 *
 * Patterns capture the three meta-fact families that AlignBench's distractor
 * pool was built from:
 *   1. "The user asked/requested/said …" — meta-facts about user actions in
 *      the conversation, not about the user.
 *   2. "As of <date>, X is a term mentioned in the conversation." — vacuous
 *      acknowledgements of vocabulary, not durable facts.
 *   3. "A name was mentioned." / "The conversation involves the user." —
 *      observations about the chat session, not about the user.
